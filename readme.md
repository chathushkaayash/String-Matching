# String Matching with Wildcards and Symbols

This code implements a string matching algorithm that supports the following features:

1. Wildcard (`.`): Matches any single character.
2. Optional character (`?`): Represents zero or one occurrence of the preceding character.
3. Caret (`^`) symbol: Matches the pattern only at the beginning of the string.
4. Escape Symbol (`\`): Used to escape a character, treating it as a literal character.

## Usage

The code consists of a Python script that defines a `matched` function and a `find` function for string matching. To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Modify the `string` and `pattern` variables in the script to the strings you want to match.

2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

## Functions

### `matched(string, pattern)`

This function takes two arguments, `string` and `pattern`, and returns `True` if the pattern matches the string according to the specified rules. It handles various special characters such as `?`, `^`, `.`, and `\`.

#### Wildcard ( `.` )

The period (`.`) character in the pattern matches any single character in the string.

#### Optional Character ( `?` )

The question mark (`?`) character in the pattern denotes an optional character. It represents either zero or one occurrence of the preceding character. The function considers both cases where the character is included and where it is omitted.

#### Caret ( `^` ) Symbol

If the pattern starts with the caret (`^`) symbol, the function attempts to match the pattern only at the beginning of the string.

#### Escape Symbol ( `\` )

The backslash (`\`) character is used as an escape symbol. It allows you to treat the following character as a literal character rather than a special symbol.

### `find(string, pattern)`

This function takes two arguments, `string` and `pattern`, and searches for all occurrences of the pattern in the given string. It uses the `matched` function to perform the matching.

If the pattern starts with the caret (`^`) symbol, the function only looks for matches at the beginning of the string. Otherwise, it searches for matches starting at different positions in the string.

## Example

```python
string = "abcd"
pattern = "ab?cd"

find(string, pattern)
```

In this example, the `find` function searches for occurrences of the pattern `"ab?cd"` in the string `"abcd"`. It considers both the optional character and the literal characters in the pattern.

## Note

This code is a simple implementation of a string matching algorithm with specific features. While it demonstrates the concept, there are more efficient algorithms available for real-world use cases.

Feel free to experiment with different strings and patterns to understand how the algorithm behaves under various conditions.
